# Event Management System - Project Idea  

## Introduction  
Managing events manually can be challenging, especially when handling registrations and tracking participants. The Event Management System aims to **simplify event organization and participation** by providing an easy-to-use platform for both **users** and **administrators**.  

## Problem Statement  
Many event organizers struggle with:  
- Keeping track of event details  
- Managing participant registrations manually  
- Communicating event updates effectively  

On the other hand, participants often face difficulties such as:  
- Finding and registering for relevant events  
- Keeping track of events they have signed up for  

## Solution  
The Event Management System provides a **centralized platform** where:  
- **Users** can easily browse, register, and track their event participation.  
- **Admins** can create and manage events, as well as view and track registrations.  

## Target Audience  
- **Event Organizers**: Who need an efficient way to manage events and participants.  
- **Attendees/Users**: Who want to find and register for events quickly.  

## Core Features  
1. **Event Management**  
   - Admins can create, edit, update, and delete events.  
2. **User Registration**  
   - Users can sign up for events and track their registered events.  
3. **Admin Dashboard**  
   - Admins can view and manage event registrations.  
4. **Role-Based Access**  
   - Users and Admins have different levels of access.  


## Expected Outcome  
By implementing this system, event management will be more **efficient, organized, and user-friendly**, reducing manual effort and ensuring smooth event participation.
